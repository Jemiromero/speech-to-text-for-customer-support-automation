## **Real-time Project - 1: Speech to Text Conversion for Transcription Services**

### üß© Problem Statement

The document identifies the increasing need for transcription of audio content like lectures, interviews, and legal proceedings. Manual transcription is slow and error-prone. Existing automated systems struggle with:

* Diverse accents and dialects
* Background noise
* Domain-specific vocabulary
* Real-time performance
* Speaker differentiation
* Data privacy

### üåü Significance

* **Saves time and cost** through automation
* **Improves accessibility** for the hearing-impaired
* **Supports business analytics** (e.g., sentiment analysis)
* **Benefits education, research, legal, and medical sectors**

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Drawbacks

* Poor handling of **accents and code-mixed language**
* Susceptibility to **noise and overlapping speech**
* Limited **domain/context awareness**
* **Latency issues** in real-time scenarios
* **Privacy risks** with cloud-based systems
* Weak **speaker diarization**

## üéØ Key Objectives

Build a **robust, real-time transcription system** that is:

* Accurate with noise, accents, homophones
* Capable of real-time or near-real-time performance
* Scalable and possibly edge-deployable

---

## üß† Suggested Architecture

### 1. **Preprocessing and Noise Reduction**

* **VAD (Voice Activity Detection)** to trim silence
* **Noise suppression** via:

  * Spectral Gating
  * Deep learning models (RNNoise, DeepFilterNet)

### 2. **Feature Extraction**

Convert audio into:

* MFCCs
* Spectrograms / Mel-spectrograms

### 3. **Acoustic Models**

Suggested pretrained models:

* Wav2Vec 2.0 (Meta)
* Whisper (OpenAI)
* Conformer (Attention + CNN hybrid)

### 4. **Language Model Integration**

Use models like GPT, BERT, or KenLM to:

* Enhance grammar and context
* Resolve homophones
* Enable autocorrection

### 5. **Post-processing**

* Add capitalization, punctuation, formatting
* Use custom dictionaries for domain-specific terms

## üß™ Optional Features

* **Accent normalization**
* **Speaker diarization**
* **Real-time transcription dashboard**

---

## üìä Recommended Datasets

* **Common Voice** (diverse accents)
* **LibriSpeech** (clean + noisy)
* **TED-LIUM**, **VoxPopuli**, **AMI Corpus**
